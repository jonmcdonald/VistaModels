NAME
       image - Create and manipulate images

SYNOPSIS
       image option ?arg arg ...?


DESCRIPTION
       The  image command is used to create, delete, and query images.  It can
       take several different forms, depending on the  option  argument.   The
       legal forms are:

       image create type ?name? ?option value ...?
              Creates  a  new  image and returns its name.  type specifies the
              type of the image, which must be  one  of  the  types  currently
              defined  (e.g., bitmap).  name specifies the name for the image;
              if it is omitted then Tk picks a name of the form imagex,  where
              x is an integer.  There may be any number of option-value pairs,
              which provide configuration options  for  the  new  image.   The
              legal  set of options is defined separately for each image type;
              see below for details on the options for built-in  image  types.
              If an image already exists by the given name then it is replaced
              with the new image and any instances of that image  will  redis-
              play  with  the  new contents.  It is important to note that the
              image command will silently overwrite  any  procedure  that  may
              currently  be  defined  by  the  given  name, so choose the name
              wisely.  It is recommended to use a separate namespace for image
              names (e.g., ::img::logo, ::img::large).

       image delete ?name name ...?
              Deletes  each  of  the named images and returns an empty string.
              If there are instances of the images displayed in  widgets,  the
              images  won't actually be deleted until all of the instances are
              released.  However, the association between  the  instances  and
              the  image  manager  will  be  dropped.  Existing instances will
              retain their sizes but redisplay as empty areas.  If  a  deleted
              image is recreated with another call to image create, the exist-
              ing instances will use the new image.

       image height name
              Returns a decimal string giving the height of image name in pix-
              els.

       image inuse name
              Returns  a  boolean  value  indicating  whether or not the image
              given by name is in use by any widgets.

       image names
              Returns a list containing the names of all existing images.

       image type name
              Returns the type of image name (the value of the  type  argument
              to image create when the image was created).

       image types
              Returns  a  list whose elements are all of the valid image types
              (i.e., all of the values that may be supplied for the type argu-
              ment to image create).

       image width name
              Returns  a decimal string giving the width of image name in pix-
              els.


BUILT-IN IMAGE TYPES
       The following image types are defined by Tk so they will  be  available
       in  any  Tk  application.   Individual  applications  or extensions may
       define additional types.

       bitmap Each pixel in the image displays a  foreground  color,  a  back-
              ground  color, or nothing.  See the bitmap manual entry for more
              information.

       photo  Displays a variety of  full-color  images,  using  dithering  to
              approximate  colors on displays with limited color capabilities.
              See the photo manual entry for more information.
