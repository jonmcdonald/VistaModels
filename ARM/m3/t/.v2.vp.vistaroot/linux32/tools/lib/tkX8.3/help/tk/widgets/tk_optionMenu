NAME
       tk_optionMenu - Create an option menubutton and its menu

SYNOPSIS
       tk_optionMenu w varName value ?value value ...?


DESCRIPTION
       This  procedure  creates  an option menubutton whose name is w, plus an
       associated menu.  Together they allow the user to  select  one  of  the
       values  given by the value arguments.  The current value will be stored
       in the global variable whose name is given by varName and it will  also
       be displayed as the label in the option menubutton.  The user can click
       on the menubutton to display a menu containing all of  the  values  and
       thereby  select  a new value.  Once a new value is selected, it will be
       stored in the variable and appear in the option menubutton.   The  cur-
       rent value can also be changed by setting the variable.

       The  return value from tk_optionMenu is the name of the menu associated
       with w, so that the caller can  change  its  configuration  options  or
       manipulate it in other ways.
