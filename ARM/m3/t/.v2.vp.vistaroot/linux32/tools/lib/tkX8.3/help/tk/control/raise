NAME
       raise - Change a window's position in the stacking order

SYNOPSIS
       raise window ?aboveThis?


DESCRIPTION
       If  the aboveThis argument is omitted then the command raises window so
       that it is above all of its siblings in the stacking order (it will not
       be  obscured by any siblings and will obscure any siblings that overlap
       it).  If aboveThis is specified then it must be the path name of a win-
       dow  that  is either a sibling of window or the descendant of a sibling
       of window.  In this case the raise command will insert window into  the
       stacking  order just above aboveThis (or the ancestor of aboveThis that
       is a sibling of window); this could end up either raising  or  lowering
       window.
