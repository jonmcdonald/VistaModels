NAME
       tk_menuBar, tk_bindForTraversal - Obsolete support for menu bars

SYNOPSIS
       tk_menuBar frame ?menu menu ...?

       tk_bindForTraversal arg arg ...


DESCRIPTION
       These  procedures were used in Tk 3.6 and earlier releases to help man-
       age pulldown menus and to implement keyboard traversal of menus.  In Tk
       4.0 and later releases they are no longer needed.  Stubs for these pro-
       cedures have been retained for backward compatibility, but they have no
       effect.   You  should  remove calls to these procedures from your code,
       since eventually the procedures will go away.
