DESCRIPTION
       The  option command allows you to add entries to the Tk option database
       or to retrieve options from the database.  The add form of the  command
       adds  a  new option to the database.  Pattern contains the option being
       specified, and consists of names and/or classes separated by  asterisks
       or  dots, in the usual X format.  Value contains a text string to asso-
       ciate with pattern;  this is the value that will be returned  in  calls
       to Tk_GetOption or by invocations of the option get command.  If prior-
       ity is specified, it indicates the priority level for this option  (see
       below  for  legal  values);   it defaults to interactive.  This command
       always returns an empty string.

       The option clear command clears the option database.   Default  options
       (from  the  RESOURCE_MANAGER  property  or the .Xdefaults file) will be
       reloaded automatically the next time an option is added to the database
       or removed from it.  This command always returns an empty string.

       The  option  get  command returns the value of the option specified for
       window under name and class.  If several entries in the option database
       match  window,  name, and class, then the command returns whichever was
       created with highest priority level.  If  there  are  several  matching
       entries at the same priority level, then it returns whichever entry was
       most recently entered into the option database.  If there are no match-
       ing entries, then the empty string is returned.

       The  readfile form of the command reads fileName, which should have the
       standard format for an X resource database such as .Xdefaults, and adds
       all the options specified in that file to the option database.  If pri-
       ority is specified, it indicates the priority level at which  to  enter
       the options;  priority defaults to interactive.

       The  priority  arguments  to  the option command are normally specified
       symbolically using one of the following values:

       widgetDefault
              Level 20.  Used for default values hard-coded into widgets.

       startupFile
              Level 40.  Used for options  specified  in  application-specific
              startup files.

       userDefault
              Level  60.  Used for options specified in user-specific defaults
              files, such as .Xdefaults, resource databases loaded into the  X
              server, or user-specific startup files.

       interactive
              Level  80.   Used  for options specified interactively after the
              application starts running.  If  priority  isn't  specified,  it
              defaults to this level.

       Any  of the above keywords may be abbreviated.  In addition, priorities
       may be specified numerically using integers between 0 and  100,  inclu-
       sive.   The numeric form is probably a bad idea except for new priority
       levels other than the ones given above.
