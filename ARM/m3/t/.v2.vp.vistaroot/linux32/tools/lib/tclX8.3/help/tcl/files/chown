       chown [-fileid] owner | {owner group} filelist
              Set  owner of each file in the list filelist to owner, which can
              be a user name or numeric user id.  If the first parameter is  a
              list, then the owner is set to the first element of the list and
              the group is set to the second element.  Group can  be  a  group
              name  or  numeric group id.  If group is {}, then the file group
              will be set to the login group of the specified user.

              If the option -fileid is specified, filelist is a list  of  open
              file  identifiers rather than a list of file names.  This option
              is not available on all Unix systems.  Use the infox have_fchown
              command to determine if this functionality is available.

              The chown command is not available on Windows 95/NT.
