NAME
       append - Append to variable

SYNOPSIS
       append varName ?value value value ...?


DESCRIPTION
       Append all of the value arguments to the current value of variable var-
       Name.  If varName doesn't exist, it is given a value equal to the  con-
       catenation  of  all the value arguments.  The result of this command is
       the new value stored in variable varName.   This  command  provides  an
       efficient  way  to build up long variables incrementally.  For example,
       ''append a $b'' is much more efficient than ''set a  $a$b''  if  $a  is
       long.
