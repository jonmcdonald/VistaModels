       cconcat ?string1? ?string2? ?...?
              Concatenate  the  arguments,  returning  the  resulting  string.
              While string concatenation is normally performed by the  parser,
              it  is  occasionally  useful  to  have  a command that returns a
              string.  The is generally useful when a command to  evaluate  is
              required.  No separators are inserted between the strings.

              This command is UTF-aware.
