       fstat fileId ?item? | ?stat arrayvar?

              Obtain status information about an open file.

              The following keys are used to identify data items:

              atime  The time of last access.

              ctime  The time of last file status change

              dev    The  device  containing  a  directory for the file.  This
                     value uniquely identifies the file system  that  contains
                     the file.

              gid    The group ID of the file's group.

              ino    The  inode  number.   This  field uniquely identifies the
                     file in a given file system.

              mode   The mode of the file (see the mknod system call).

              mtime  Time when the data in the file was last modified.

              nlink  The number of links to the file.

              size   The file size in bytes.

              tty    If the file is associated with a terminal, then 1  other-
                     wise 0.

              type   The  type  of  the file in symbolic form, which is one of
                     the following values: file, directory,  characterSpecial,
                     blockSpecial, fifo, link, or socket.

              uid    The user ID of the file's owner.

              If  one  of these keys is specified as item, then that data item
              is returned.

              If stat arrayvar is specified, then the information is  returned
              in  the  array arrayvar.  Each of the above keys indexes an ele-
              ment of the array containing the data.

              If only fileId is specified, the command returns the data  as  a
              keyed list.

              The  following  values  may be returned only if explicitly asked
              for, it will not be returned with the array or keyed list forms:

              remotehost
                     If  fileId  is a TCP/IP socket connection, then a list is
                     returned with the first element being the remote host  IP
                     address.   If  the  remote  host name can be found, it is
                     returned as the second element of the list.   The  remote
                     host IP port number is the third element.

              localhost
                     If  fileId  is a TCP/IP socket connection, then a list is
                     returned with the first element being the local  host  IP
                     address.   If  the  local  host  name can be found, it is
                     returned as the second element of the  list.   The  local
                     host IP port number is the third element.
