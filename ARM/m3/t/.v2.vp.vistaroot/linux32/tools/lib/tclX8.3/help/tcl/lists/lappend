NAME
       lappend - Append list elements onto a variable

SYNOPSIS
       lappend varName ?value value value ...?


DESCRIPTION
       This command treats the variable given by varName as a list and appends
       each of the value arguments to that list as a  separate  element,  with
       spaces  between elements.  If varName doesn't exist, it is created as a
       list with elements given by the value arguments.  Lappend is similar to
       append except that the values are appended as list elements rather than
       raw text.  This command provides a relatively efficient way to build up
       large lists.  For example, ''lappend a $b'' is much more efficient than
       ''set a [concat $a [list $b]]'' when $a is long.
