       for_recursive_glob var dirlist globlist code
              This  procedure  performs  a foreach-style loop over recursively
              matched files.   All  directories  in  dirlist  are  recursively
              searched  (breadth-first), comparing each file found against the
              file glob patterns in globlist.   For  each  matched  file,  the
              variable  var  is  set  to  the file path and code is evaluated.
              Symbolic links are not followed.
