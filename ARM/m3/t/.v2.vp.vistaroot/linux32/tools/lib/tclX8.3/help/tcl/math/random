       random limit | seed ?seedval?
              Generate  a pseudorandom integer number greater than or equal to
              zero and less than limit.  If seed is specified, then  the  com-
              mand  resets  the  random  number  generator to a starting point
              derived from the seedval. This allows one to  reproduce  pseudo-
              random  number  sequences  for  testing purposes.  If seedval is
              omitted, then the seed is set to a value based on current system
              state  and  the current time, providing a reasonably interesting
              and ever-changing seed.
