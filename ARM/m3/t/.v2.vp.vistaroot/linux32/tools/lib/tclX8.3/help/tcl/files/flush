NAME
       flush - Flush buffered output for a channel

SYNOPSIS
       flush channelId


DESCRIPTION
       Flushes any output that has been buffered for channelId.

       ChannelId must be an identifier for an open channel such as a Tcl stan-
       dard channel (stdout or stderr), the return value from an invocation of
       open or socket, or the result of a channel creation command provided by
       a Tcl extension.  The channel must have been opened for writing.

       If the channel is in blocking mode the command does  not  return  until
       all the buffered output has been flushed to the channel. If the channel
       is in nonblocking mode, the command may return before all buffered out-
       put  has  been flushed; the remainder will be flushed in the background
       as fast as the underlying file or device is able to absorb it.
