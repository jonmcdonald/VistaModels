       translit inrange outrange string
              Translate characters in string, changing characters occurring in
              inrange to the corresponding character in outrange. Inrange  and
              outrange may be list of characters or a range in the form 'A-M'.
              For example:
                      translit a-z A-Z foobar

              This command currently only supports characters in ASCII range; UTF-8 characters
              out of this range will generate an error.
