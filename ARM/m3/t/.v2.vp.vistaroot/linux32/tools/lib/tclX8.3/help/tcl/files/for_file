       for_file var filename code
              This  procedure  implements  a loop over the contents of a file.
              For each line in filename, it sets var to the line and  executes
              code.

              The break and continue commands work as with foreach.

              For example, the command

                   for_file line /etc/passwd {echo $line}

              would echo all the lines in the password file.
