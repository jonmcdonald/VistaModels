       cequal string string
              This command compares two strings for equality.  It returns 1 if
              string1 and string2 are the identical and 0  if  they  are  not.
              This  command  is  a short-cut for string compare and avoids the
              problems with string expressions being  treated  unintentionally
              as numbers.

              This command is UTF-aware and will also work on binary data.
