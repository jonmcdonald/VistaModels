       edprocs ?proc...?
              This  procedure  writes  the  named procedures, or all currently
              defined procedures, to a temporary file, then calls an editor on
              it  (as  specified  by the EDITOR environment variable, or vi if
              none is specified), then sources the file  back  in  if  it  was
              changed.
