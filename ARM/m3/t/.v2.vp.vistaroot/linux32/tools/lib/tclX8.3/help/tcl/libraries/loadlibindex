loadlibindex libfile.tlib
Load  the  package  library index of the library file libfile (which must have
the suffix .tlib).  Package library indexes along  the  auto_path  are  loaded
automatically on the first demand_load; this command is provided to explicitly
load libraries that are not in the path.  If the index file (with a .tndx suf-
fix)  does  not  exists  or is out of date, it will be rebuilt if the user has
directory permissions to create it. If a package with the same name as a pack-
age in libfile.tlib has already been loaded, its definition will be overridden
by the new package.  However, if any procedure has actually been used from the
previously  defined  package,  the  procedures  from  libfile.tlib will not be
loaded.
