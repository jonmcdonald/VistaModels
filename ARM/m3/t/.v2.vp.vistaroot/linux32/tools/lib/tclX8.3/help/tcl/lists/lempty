       lempty list
              Determine  if  the  specified  list  is  empty.   If empty, 1 is
              returned, otherwise, 0 is returned.  This command is an alterna-
              tive  to  comparing a list to an empty string, however it checks
              for a string of all whitespaces, which is an empty list.
