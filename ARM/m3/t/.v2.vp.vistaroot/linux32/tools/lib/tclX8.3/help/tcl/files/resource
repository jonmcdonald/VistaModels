NAME
       resource - Manipulate Macintosh resources

SYNOPSIS
       resource option ?arg arg ...?


DESCRIPTION
       The  resource command provides some generic operations for dealing with
       Macintosh resources.  This command is only supported on  the  Macintosh
       platform.  Each Macintosh file consists of two forks: a data fork and a
       resource fork.  You use the normal open, puts, close, etc. commands  to
       manipulate  the  data  fork.   You  must  use this command, however, to
       interact with the resource fork.  Option indicates what  resource  com-
       mand  to  perform.   Any  unique abbreviation for option is acceptable.
       The valid options are:

       resource close rsrcRef
              Closes the given  resource  reference  (obtained  from  resource
              open).   Resources  from  that  resource  file will no longer be
              available.

       resource delete ?options? resourceType
              This command will delete the resource specified by  options  and
              type  resourceType (see RESOURCE TYPES below).  The options give
              you several ways to specify the resource to be deleted.

              -id resourceId
                     If the  -id  option  is  given  the  id  resourceId  (see
                     RESOURCE IDS below) is used to specify the resource to be
                     deleted.  The id must be a number - to specify a name use
                     the -name option.

              -name resourceName
                     If  -name  is  specified, the resource named resourceName
                     will be deleted.  If the -id is also provided, then there
                     must  be  a resource with BOTH this name and this id.  If
                     no name is provided, then the id will be used  regardless
                     of the name of the actual resource.

              -file resourceRef
                     If  the  -file option is specified then the resource will
                     be deleted from the file pointed to by resourceRef.  Oth-
                     erwise the first resource with the given resourceName and
                     or resourceId which is found on the  resource  file  path
                     will  be  deleted.   To  inspect  the  file path, use the
                     resource files command.

       resource files ?resourceRef?
              If resourceRefis not provided, this command returns a  Tcl  list
              of  the  resource references for all the currently open resource
              files.  The list is in the normal  Macintosh  search  order  for
              resources.  If resourceRef is specified, the command will return
              the path to the file whose resource fork is represented by  that
              token.

       resource list resourceType ?resourceRef?
              List all of the resources ids of type resourceType (see RESOURCE
              TYPES below).  If resourceRef is specified then the command will
              limit  the  search to that particular resource file.  Otherwise,
              all resource files currently opened by the application  will  be
              searched.   A Tcl list of either the resource name's or resource
              id's of the found resources will be returned.  See the  RESOURCE
              IDS  section below for more details about what a resource id is.

       resource open fileName ?access?
              Open the resource for the file fileName.  Standard  file  access
              permissions may also be specified (see the manual entry for open
              for details).  A resource reference  (resourceRef)  is  returned
              that  can  be used by the other resource commands.  An error can
              occur if the file doesn't exist or the  file  does  not  have  a
              resource fork.  However, if you open the file with write permis-
              sions the file and/or resource fork will be created  instead  of
              generating an error.

       resource read resourceType resourceId ?resourceRef?
              Read  the  entire  resource  of  type resourceType (see RESOURCE
              TYPES below) and the name or id of resourceId (see RESOURCE  IDS
              below)  into  memory  and  return the result.  If resourceRef is
              specified we limit our search to that resource  file,  otherwise
              we  search  all  open  resource forks in the application.  It is
              important to note that most Macintosh resource use a binary for-
              mat  and  the  data returned from this command may have embedded
              NULLs or other non-ASCII data.

       resource types ?resourceRef?
              This command returns a Tcl  list  of  all  resource  types  (see
              RESOURCE  TYPES  below) found in the resource file pointed to by
              resourceRef.  If resourceRef is not specified it will return all
              the resource types found in every resource file currently opened
              by the application.

       resource write ?options? resourceType data
              This command will write the passed in data as a new resource  of
              type  resourceType  (see RESOURCE TYPES below).  Several options
              are available that  describe  where  and  how  the  resource  is
              stored.

              -id resourceId
                     If  the  -id  option  is  given  the  id  resourceId (see
                     RESOURCE IDS below) is used for the new resource,  other-
                     wise a unique id will be generated that will not conflict
                     with any existing resource.  However, the id  must  be  a
                     number - to specify a name use the -name option.

              -name resourceName
                     If   -name  is  specified  the  resource  will  be  named
                     resourceName, otherwise it will have the empty string  as
                     the name.

              -file resourceRef
                     If  the  -file option is specified then the resource will
                     be written in the file pointed to by resourceRef,  other-
                     wise the most recently open resource will be used.

              -force If  the  target  resource already exists, then by default
                     Tcl will not overwrite it, but raise  an  error  instead.
                     Use  the  -force  flag  to  force  overwriting the extant
                     resource.


RESOURCE TYPES
       Resource types are defined as a four  character  string  that  is  then
       mapped  to an underlying id.  For example, TEXT refers to the Macintosh
       resource type for text.  The type STR# is a list  of  counted  strings.
       All Macintosh resources must be of some type.  See Macintosh documenta-
       tion for a more complete list of resource types that are commonly used.


RESOURCE IDS
       For  this  command  the  notion of a resource id actually refers to two
       ideas in Macintosh resources.  Every place you can use  a  resource  Id
       you  can  use either the resource name or a resource number.  Names are
       always searched or returned in preference to numbers.  For example, the
       resource list command will return names if they exist or numbers if the
       name is NULL.


PORTABILITY ISSUES
       The resource command is only available on Macintosh.
