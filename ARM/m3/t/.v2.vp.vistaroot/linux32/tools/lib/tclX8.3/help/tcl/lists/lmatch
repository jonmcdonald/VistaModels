       lmatch ?mode? list pattern

              Search  the  elements  of list, returning a list of all elements
              matching pattern.  If none match, an empty list is returned.

              The mode argument indicates how the elements of the list are  to
              be matched against pattern and it must have one of the following
              values:

              -exact The list element must contain exactly the same string  as
                     pattern.

              -glob  Pattern  is a glob-style pattern which is matched against
                     each list element using the  same  rules  as  the  string
                     match command.

              -regexp
                     Pattern  is  treated  as a regular expression and matched
                     against each list element using the  same  rules  as  the
                     regexp command.

              If mode is omitted then it defaults to -glob.

              Only the -exact comparison will work on binary data.
