       catopen ?-fail | -nofail? catname
              Open  the  message catalog catname.  This may be a relative path
              name, in which case the NLSPATH environment variable is searched
              to  find  an  absolute path to the message catalog.  A handle in
              the form msgcatN is returned.  Normally, errors are ignored, and
              in the case of a failed call to catopen, a handle is returned to
              an unopened message catalog.  (This handle may still  be  passed
              to  catgets  and  catclose, causing catgets to simply return the
              default string, as described above.   If  the  -fail  option  is
              specified,  an  error is returned if the open fails.  The option
              -nofail specifies the default behavior of not returning an error
              when  catopen fails to open a specified message catalog.  If the
              handle from a failed catopen is passed to catgets,  the  default
              string is returned.
