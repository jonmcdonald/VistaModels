       id options

              This command provides a means of getting, setting and converting
              user, group and process ids.  The id command has  the  following
              options:

              id user ?name?

              id userid ?uid?
                     Set the real and effective user ID to name or uid, if the
                     name (or uid) is valid and permissions allow it.  If  the
                     name (or uid) is not specified, the current name (or uid)
                     is returned.

              id convert userid uid
