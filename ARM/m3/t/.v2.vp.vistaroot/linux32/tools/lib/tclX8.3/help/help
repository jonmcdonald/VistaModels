       The  help  facility  allows  one  to  look  up  help  pages which where
       extracted from the standard Tcl manual pages and Tcl scripts during Tcl
       installation.   Help  files are structured as a multilevel tree of sub-
       jects and help pages.  Help files are found  by  searching  directories
       named help in the directories listed in the auto_path variable.  All of
       the files in the list of help directories form a virtual  root  of  the
       help  tree.   This  method allows multiple applications to provide help
       trees without having the files reside in the same directory.

       The help facility can be accessed in two ways, as interactive  commands
       in the Extended Tcl shell or as an interactive Tk-based program (if you
       have built Extended Tcl with Tk).

       To run the Tk-based interactive help program:

           tclhelp ?addpaths?

       Where addpaths are additional paths to search for help directories.  By
       default,  only  the  auto_path  used  by  tclhelp is search.  This will
       result in help on Tcl, Extended Tcl and Tk.

       The following interactive Tcl commands and options  are  provided  with
       the help package:

       help
              Help,  without  arguments,  lists  of  all the help subjects and
              pages under the current help subject.

       help subject
              Displays all of help pages and  lower  level  subjects  (if  any
              exist) under the subject subject.

       help subject/helppage
              Display  the  specified  help  page.   The help output is passed
              through a simple pager if output exceeds 23 lines, pausing wait-
              ing  for  a  return  to  be  entered.  If any other character is
              entered, the output is terminated.

       helpcd ?subject?
              Change the current subject, which is much like the Unix  current
              directory.  If subject is not specified, return to the top-level
              of the help tree.  Help subject  path  names  may  also  include
              ''..'' elements.

       helppwd
              Displays the current help subject.

       help help | ?
              Displays help on the help facility at any directory level.

       apropos pattern
              This  command  locates  subjects  by  searching  their  one-line
              descriptions for a pattern.  Apropos  is  useful  when  you  can
              remember  part of the name or description of a command, and want
              to search through the one-line  summaries  for  matching  lines.
              Full  regular  expressions may be specified (see the regexp com-
              mand).
