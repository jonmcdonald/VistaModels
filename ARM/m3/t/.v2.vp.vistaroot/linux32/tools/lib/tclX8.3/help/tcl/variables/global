NAME
       global - Access global variables

SYNOPSIS
       global varname ?varname ...?


DESCRIPTION
       This  command  is  ignored unless a Tcl procedure is being interpreted.
       If so then it declares the  given  varname's  to  be  global  variables
       rather  than  local ones.  Global variables are variables in the global
       namespace.  For the duration of the current procedure (and  only  while
       executing  in  the current procedure), any reference to any of the var-
       names will refer to the global variable by the same name.
