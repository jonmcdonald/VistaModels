NAME
       pid - Retrieve process id(s)

SYNOPSIS
       pid ?fileId?


DESCRIPTION
       If the fileId argument is given then it should normally refer to a pro-
       cess pipeline created with the open command.  In this case the pid com-
       mand  will  return a list whose elements are the process identifiers of
       all the processes in the pipeline, in order.  The list will be empty if
       fileId  refers  to  an  open file that isn't a process pipeline.  If no
       fileId argument is given then pid returns the process identifier of the
       current  process.   All  process  identifiers  are  returned as decimal
       strings.
