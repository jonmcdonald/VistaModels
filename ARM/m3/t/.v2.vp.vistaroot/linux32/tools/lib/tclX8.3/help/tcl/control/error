NAME
       error - Generate an error

SYNOPSIS
       error message ?info? ?code?


DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  TCL_ERROR  code,  which causes command interpretation to be
       unwound.  Message is a string that is returned to  the  application  to
       indicate what went wrong.

       If  the  info argument is provided and is non-empty, it is used to ini-
       tialize the global variable errorInfo.  errorInfo is used to accumulate
       a stack trace of what was in progress when an error occurred; as nested
       commands unwind, the Tcl interpreter adds information to errorInfo.  If
       the  info  argument  is present, it is used to initialize errorInfo and
       the first increment of unwind information will not be added by the  Tcl
       interpreter.   In other words, the command containing the error command
       will not appear in errorInfo; in its place will be info.  This  feature
       is most useful in conjunction with the catch command: if a caught error
       cannot be handled successfully, info can be  used  to  return  a  stack
       trace reflecting the original point of occurrence of the error:
              catch {...} errMsg
              set savedInfo $errorInfo
              ...
              error $errMsg $savedInfo

       If the code argument is present, then its value is stored in the error-
       Code global variable.  This variable is intended  to  hold  a  machine-
       readable  description  of  the error in cases where such information is
       available; see the tclvars manual page for information  on  the  proper
       format  for  the  variable.   If the code argument is not present, then
       errorCode is automatically reset to ''NONE'' by the Tcl interpreter  as
       part of processing the error generated by the command.
