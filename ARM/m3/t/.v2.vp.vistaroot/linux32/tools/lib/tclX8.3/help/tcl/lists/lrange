NAME
       lrange - Return one or more adjacent elements from a list

SYNOPSIS
       lrange list first last


DESCRIPTION
       List  must  be  a  valid Tcl list.  This command will return a new list
       consisting of elements first through last, inclusive.   First  or  last
       may  be end (or any abbreviation of it) to refer to the last element of
       the list.  If first is less than zero, it is  treated  as  if  it  were
       zero.   If  last  is greater than or equal to the number of elements in
       the list, then it is treated as if it were end.  If  first  is  greater
       than  last then an empty string is returned.  Note: ''lrange list first
       first'' does not always  produce  the  same  result  as  ''lindex  list
       first''  (although it often does for simple fields that aren't enclosed
       in braces); it does, however,  produce  exactly  the  same  results  as
       ''list [lindex list first]''
