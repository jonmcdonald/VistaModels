NAME
       split - Split a string into a proper Tcl list

SYNOPSIS
       split string ?splitChars?


DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list created by splitting string at each character that is in
       the splitChars argument.  Each element of the result list will  consist
       of the characters from string that lie between instances of the charac-
       ters in splitChars.  Empty list elements will be  generated  if  string
       contains  adjacent  characters  in  splitChars, or if the first or last
       character of string is in splitChars.  If splitChars is an empty string
       then  each character of string becomes a separate element of the result
       list.  SplitChars defaults to the standard white-space characters.  For
       example,
              split "comp.unix.misc" .
       returns "comp unix misc" and
              split "Hello world" {}
       returns "H e l l o { } w o r l d".
