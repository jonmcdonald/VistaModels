NAME
       fblocked  -  Test whether the last input operation exhausted all avail-
       able input

SYNOPSIS
       fblocked channelId


DESCRIPTION
       The fblocked command returns 1 if the most recent  input  operation  on
       channelId  returned  less information than requested because all avail-
       able input was exhausted.  For example, if gets is invoked  when  there
       are  only  three  characters  available  for  input  and no end-of-line
       sequence, gets returns  an  empty  string  and  a  subsequent  call  to
       fblocked will return 1.

       ChannelId must be an identifier for an open channel such as a Tcl stan-
       dard channel (stdin, stdout, or stderr), the return value from an invo-
       cation  of  open or socket, or the result of a channel creation command
       provided by a Tcl extension.
