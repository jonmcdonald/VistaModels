       nice ?priorityincr?

              Change or return the process priority.  If priorityincr is omit-
              ted, the current priority is returned.  If priorityincr is posi-
              tive,  it is added to the current priority level, up to a system
              defined maximum (normally 19),

              Negative priorityincr values cumulatively increase the program's
              priority  down  to  a  system  defined  minimum  (normally -19);
              increasing priority with negative niceness values will only work
              for the superuser.

              The new priority is returned.

              The nice command is not available on Windows 95/NT.
