NAME
       tell - Return current access position for an open channel

SYNOPSIS
       tell channelId


DESCRIPTION
       Returns  an  integer string giving the current access position in chan-
       nelId.  This value returned is a byte offset that can be passed to seek
       in  order  to set the channel to a particular position.  Note that this
       value is in terms of  bytes,  not  characters  like  read.   The  value
       returned is -1 for channels that do not support seeking.

       ChannelId must be an identifier for an open channel such as a Tcl stan-
       dard channel (stdin, stdout, or stderr), the return value from an invo-
       cation  of  open or socket, or the result of a channel creation command
       provided by a Tcl extension.
