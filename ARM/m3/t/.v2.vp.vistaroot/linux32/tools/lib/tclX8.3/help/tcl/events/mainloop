       mainloop
              This  procedure sets up a top-level event loop.  Events are pro-
              cessed until there are no more active event  sources,  at  which
              time the process exits.  It is used to build event oriented pro-
              grams using the TclX shell in a style similar to that used  with
              wish.   If  the global variable tcl_interactive exists and has a
              true value an interactive command handler is  started  as  well.
              If the command handler is terminated by an EOF, the process will
              be exited.

              This commands is not useful in wishx, as it automatically enters
              an event loop after processing a script.
