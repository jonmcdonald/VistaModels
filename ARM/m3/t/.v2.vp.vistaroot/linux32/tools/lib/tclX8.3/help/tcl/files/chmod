       chmod [-fileid] mode filelist
              Set  permissions  of  each  of the files in the list filelist to
              mode, where mode is an absolute numeric mode or symbolic permis-
              sions  as  in  the  UNIX chmod(1) command.  To specify a mode as
              octal, it should be prefixed with a "0" (e.g. 0622).

              If the option -fileid is specified, filelist is a list  of  open
              file  identifiers rather than a list of file names.  This option
              is not available on all Unix systems.  Use the infox have_fchmod
              command to determine if this functionality is available.

              The chmod command is not available on Windows 95/NT.
