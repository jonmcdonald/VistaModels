convert_lib tclIndex packagelib ?ignore?
Convert a Ousterhout style tclIndex index file and associate source files into
a package library packagelib.  If packagelib does not have a .tlib  extension,
one  will  be  added.   Any  files  specified in tclIndex that are in the list
ignore will be skipped.  Files listed in ignore should just be the  base  file
names, not full paths.
