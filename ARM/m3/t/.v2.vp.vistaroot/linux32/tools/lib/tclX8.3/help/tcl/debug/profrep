       profrep profDataVar sortKey ?outFile? ?userTitle?
              This  procedure  generates  a  report from data collect from the
              profile command.  ProfDataVar is the name of the array  contain-
              ing  the data returned by the profile command. SortKey indicates
              which data value to sort by.  It should be one of "calls", "cpu"
              or  "real".  OutFile is the name of file to write the report to.
              If omitted, stdout is assumed.  UserTitle is an  optional  title
              line to add to output.

              Listed  with  indentation below each procedure or command is the
              procedure call stack.  The first indented line being the  proce-
              dure  that  invoked the reported procedure or command.  The next
              line is the procedure that invoked the procedure above  it,  and
              so  on.   If  no indented procedures are shown, the procedure or
              command was called from the global context.  Time actually spent
              in  the  global  context  is  listed on a line labeled <global>.
              Upleveled code is reported in the context that it  was  executed
              in, not the context that the uplevel was called in.
