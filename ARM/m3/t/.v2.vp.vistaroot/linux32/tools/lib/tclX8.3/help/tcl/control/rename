NAME
       rename - Rename or delete a command

SYNOPSIS
       rename oldName newName


DESCRIPTION
       Rename  the  command  that  used to be called oldName so that it is now
       called newName.  If newName is an empty string then oldName is deleted.
       oldName and newName may include namespace qualifiers (names of contain-
       ing namespaces).  If a command is renamed into a  different  namespace,
       future invocations of it will execute in the new namespace.  The rename
       command returns an empty string as result.
