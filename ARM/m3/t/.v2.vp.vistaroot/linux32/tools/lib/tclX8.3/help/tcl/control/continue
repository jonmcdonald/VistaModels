NAME
       continue - Skip to the next iteration of a loop

SYNOPSIS
       continue


DESCRIPTION
       This  command is typically invoked inside the body of a looping command
       such as for or foreach or while.  It returns a TCL_CONTINUE code, which
       causes a continue exception to occur.  The exception causes the current
       script to be aborted out to  the  innermost  containing  loop  command,
       which then continues with the next iteration of the loop.  Catch excep-
       tions are also handled in a few other situations,  such  as  the  catch
       command and the outermost scripts of procedure bodies.
