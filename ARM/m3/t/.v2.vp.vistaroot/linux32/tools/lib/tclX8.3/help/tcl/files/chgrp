       chgrp [-fileid] group filelist
              Set  the  group  id  of each file in the list filelist to group,
              which can be either a group name or a numeric group id.

              If the option -fileid is specified, filelist is a list  of  open
              file  identifiers rather than a list of file names.  This option
              is not available on all Unix systems.  Use the infox have_fchown
              command to determine if this functionality is available.

              The chgrp command is not available on Windows 95/NT.
