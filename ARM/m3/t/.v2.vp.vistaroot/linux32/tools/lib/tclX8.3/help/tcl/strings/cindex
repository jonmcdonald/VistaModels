       cindex string indexExpr
              Returns  the character indexed by the expression indexExpr (zero
              based) from string.

              If the expression indexExpr starts with the string end, then end
              is  replaced with the index of the last character in the string.
              If the expression starts with len, then len is replaced with the
              length of the string.

              This command is UTF-aware.
