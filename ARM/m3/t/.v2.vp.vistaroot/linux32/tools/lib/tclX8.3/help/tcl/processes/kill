       kill ?-pgroup ?signal? idlist

              Send a signal to the each process in the list idlist, if permit-
              ted.  Signal, if present, is the signal number or  the  symbolic
              name of the signal, see the signal system call manual page.  The
              leading ''SIG'' is optional when the signal is specified by  its
              symbolic name.  The default for signo is 15, SIGTERM.

              If  -pgroup is specified, the numbers in idlist are take as pro-
              cess group ids and the signal is sent to all of the  process  in
              that  process group.  A process group id of 0 specifies the cur-
              rent process group.

              The kill command is not available on Windows 95/NT.
