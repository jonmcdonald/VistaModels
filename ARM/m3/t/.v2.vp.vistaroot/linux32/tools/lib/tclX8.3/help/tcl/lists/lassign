       lassign list var ?var...?
              Assign successive elements of a list to specified variables.  If
              there are more variable names than fields, the  remaining  vari-
              ables  are  set to the empty string.  If there are more elements
              than variables, a list of the unassigned elements is returned.

              For example,

                  lassign {dave 100 200 {Dave Foo}} name uid gid longName

              Assigns name to ''dave'', uid to ''100'', gid  to  ''200'',  and
              longName to ''Dave Foo''.
