       catclose ?-fail | -nofail? cathandle
              Close  the  message  catalog  specified by cathandle.  Normally,
              errors are ignored.  If -fail is specified, any  errors  closing
              the message catalog file are returned.  The option -nofail spec-
              ifies the default behavior of not returning an error.   The  use
              of  -fail  only makes sense if it was also specified in the call
              to catopen.
