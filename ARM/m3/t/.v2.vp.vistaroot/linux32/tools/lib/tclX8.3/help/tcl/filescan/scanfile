       scanfile ?-copyfile copyFileId? contexthandle fileId
              Scan  the  file  specified  by fileId, starting from the current
              file position.  Check all patterns in the scan context specified
              by contexthandle against it, executing the match commands corre-
              sponding to patterns matched.

              If the optional -copyfile argument is specified, the next  argu-
              ment  is a file ID to which all lines not matched by any pattern
              (excluding the default pattern) are to be written.  If the  copy
              file  is specified with this flag, instead of using the scancon-
              text copyfile command, the file is disassociated from  the  scan
              context at the end of the scan.

              This  command  does  not  work  on  files containing binary data
              (bytes of zero).
