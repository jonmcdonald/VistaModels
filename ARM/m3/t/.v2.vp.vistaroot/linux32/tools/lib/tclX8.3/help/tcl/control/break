NAME
       break - Abort looping command

SYNOPSIS
       break


DESCRIPTION
       This  command is typically invoked inside the body of a looping command
       such as for or foreach or while.  It returns a  TCL_BREAK  code,  which
       causes  a  break  exception to occur.  The exception causes the current
       script to be aborted out to  the  innermost  containing  loop  command,
       which then aborts its execution and returns normally.  Break exceptions
       are also handled in a few other situations, such as the catch  command,
       Tk event bindings, and the outermost scripts of procedure bodies.
