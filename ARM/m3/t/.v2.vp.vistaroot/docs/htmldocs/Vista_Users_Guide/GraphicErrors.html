 <p class="pReportBody">This document contains errors related to converting graphics.
<br>You must correct these errors before shipping this manual.</p>
<p class="pReportBody">These graphic errors are caused by a defect in the Quadralay WebWorks application (UNIX only).
<br>It usually manifests itself when converting FrameMaker native graphics or when you use an ovelay, such as callouts or image maps over a referenced or copied graphic, usually GIFs.  However, ordinary FrameMaker native graphics can also have conversion problems.</p>
<p class="pReportBody">To correct this problem, follow the instructions below for <b>each</b> problem graphic.</p>
<ol>
<li class="LL2Seq">If the source of the problem graphic is a GIF, replace it with a JPG of the same graphic.  You can use SnagIt or Corel to save a JPG copy of your graphic.</li>
<li class="LL2Seq">If you don't already have a text frame in the graphic, add a text frame to the graphic.  Location doesn't matter.</li>
<li class="LL2Seq">Add a "GraphicStyle" marker with a value of "PNG" to the text frame.  If the GraphicStyle marker doesn't exist in your Frame document, you will have to create it with the "Edit" entry in the marker catalog.</li>
<li class="LL2Seq">Save and reconvert your manual.</li></ol>
<p class="pReportBody">If you continue to have problems after attempting this fix, copy your ENTIRE manual to <i>/user/mmaster/wwp_in</i>, then
contact Regis Krug or Sarah Leritz-Higgins for further instructions.</p>
