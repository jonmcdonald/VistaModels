Create VP analysis data, run vp with:
	run.exe -analysis -vp_trace_power -vp_trace_cache -vp_trace_attributes -simdir vp_sim
Create database
	prepare_analysis_database.exe -simdir vp_sim

Now there should be analysis_db_accessor.32.so and MGC_VISTA_SIM_histor.data.analysis.analog 
in the vp_sim dir.

To build from scratch the following steps should reconstruct all files:
> make mb
> make
> sourcerygxx-ide -data CBwork
	Build software projects.
	To create the projects if they do not exist in CB execute the following:
	- File->Import
	- General->Existing Projects into Workspace
	- Select root directory -> Browse... select CBwork/<dirname> then OK
	- Finish

  For software the following projects are useful and are found under CBwork
	demo - basic simple demo program
	Vista-CM3 - similar basic program but uses ARM CMSIS configuration for peripheral definitions.
	AES - Software implementation of AES encryption algorithm
	AEShw - algorithm using HW accelerator block.  Requires rijndael_tb.h as top level block diagram

To setup Vista project.
> vista &
	- File->Open Library Manager
		Add Models and blocks_lib as libraries
	- Project->Open Project
		Open M3.v2p
	The project should now build and simulate
