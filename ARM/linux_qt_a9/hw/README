This is a simple ARM dual core Cortex A9 platform including a variety of useful peripherals.

1) make clean; make mb; make 

2) make run (once you've built the software image)

3) login as root, passwd="root"

4) es2gears


The custom peripheral GUI is created by the python script - peripheral.py. This gets launched
automatically when the simulation is ran. It connects to the simulation via a socket.


NOTE: If you are using VMWare then you will notice your mouse
      will not function.
      There is a workaround for this, halt your VMWare machine, edit the 
      VMWare machine config file, for example: "Ubuntu.vmx", and make sure
      that this option is set to FALSE:
      vmmouse.present = "FALSE"
