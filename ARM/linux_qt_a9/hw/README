1) make

2) make run (once you've built the software image)

3) login to LCD console as root, passwd="root"

4) cd embedded/lightmaps

NOTE: If you are using VMWare then you will notice your mouse
      will not function.

      This is because VMWare is grabbing the mouse and messing it up.

      There is a workaround for this, halt your VMWare machine, edit the 
      VMWare machine config file, for example: "Ubuntu.vmx", and make sure
      that this option is set to FALSE:

      vmmouse.present = "FALSE"
