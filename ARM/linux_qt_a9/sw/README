0) Edit ./setup.sh 

   Uncomment the VER_QT section if you want to download and build QT.

   This has been tested using the tool chain included with CB_VE_2013.11

   For now, this works better with QT 4.8.5 because it include a window manager
   to manager the keyboard and mouse. The patch for the USB device
   tree support only seems to work in the very latest kernels.

1) Run ./script/fetch.sh

   This will download and uncompress the required packages.

   Note that wget may fail when it tries to download dropbear,
   if this is the case it means your wget has not been compiled
   to support https protocol. You can manually get dropbear and
   place it in the packages folder.

2) Run ./script/build_kernel.sh

   First the kernel_patches are applied, one to enable device tree for the 
   LCD PL111, one to enable the device tree for the USB EHCI, and
   finally a patch which includes support for our generic Vista 
   based platform. You can issue a "grep +++ ./kernel_patches/vista.patch" to
   list the files that are included in the patch and then examine them.

   An important file is the device tree definition, which you can find at:
   /packages/linux-$VER_LINUX/arch/arm/boot/dts/vista.dts

3) Run ./script/build_busybox.sh

   Builds the busybox utilities. *NOTE* you may get an warning about the maths
   library at the end, but this is safe to ignore.

4) Run ./script/build_dropbear.sh

   Builds the dropbear utilities which provide a SSH server in our platform.

5) Optionally, run ./script/build_qt.sh 

   This builds QT shared libraries and demos, this takes a little while. If you
   build this then the ramdisk creation will modify the inittab to boot the qt
   launcher, examine the script/build_ramdisk.sh.

6) Optionally, you can run the following:

	./script/build_tools.sh          # build tools needed for mesa3d
	./script/build_drm.sh            # drm library needed for mesa3d
	./script/build_expat.sh          # xml parsing needed for mesa3d
	./script/build_mesa3d.sh         # OpenGL-ES1 and OpenGL-ES2 libraries
	./script/build_gears.sh          # OpenGL-ES1 and OpenGL-ES2 demo's
	./script/build_sdl.sh            # SDL library, quake3 uses this

   If you build the gears demos, then when you boot the platform you can run
   them from a console with "es1gears" or "es2gears" to exercise the different
   OpenGL versions. Note that the OpenGL-ES libraries are pure software based.

7) Run ./script/build_ramdisk.sh

   This creates the ram disk image, based upon the "template" folder, it then
   installs the c libraries from the tool-chain, the kernel stuff, busybox
   and dropbear, and finally the QT libraries and a few demos

8) Run ./script/build_axf.sh

   This is the black-art boot loader that creates a single axf image ready
   for us to run on our Vista platform.

9) Run up the platform, go the the hw folder and then:
 
   vista_simulate Project
