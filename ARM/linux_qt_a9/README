This example shows how it is possible to build a simple platform and run
a recent Linux kernel and home made file system upon it. It includes an 
example to show how a Linux driver can be built to handle a LED peripheral.

The platform includes:
	Dual Core Cortex A9
	Memory
	FrameBuffer LCD (with support for GPU bridge)
	UART
	USB
	Ethernet
	SDCard (used for root filesystem)
	LED Custom Peripheral with button to trigger interrupt
