To build Qt you need gcc 4.8.x or higher in your PATH, to confirm type:

> gcc --version

You need ARM cross compilers installed for bare metal and linux, to confirm type:

> arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
> arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc --version


To build, please type:

make clean  : cleans everything
make all    : builds linux, Qt, and the filesystem tools


Once complete you should expect to find these files:

boot/linux-kernel.axf  : linux kernel image
sdcard/sysroot.ext2    : filesystem image
