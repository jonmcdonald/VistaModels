This directory has been initialized with startup files to streamline the initial Vista
usage.  These files can be used for any initial Vista working area.  The files are not
specific to any particuar directory path or model names. 

The following items are included:

Makefile	: Make targets for simplifying Vista usage.  Useful targets include:
	"make"	: Create and load .mb files into papoulis_project directory if it does not exist
		  Compile all .cpp files
		  Build the vista project.
	"make vista" : Build any out of date files and start vista simulation in Gui
	"make batch" : Build out of date files and run simulation in Vista batch
	"make clean" : Remove all binary and intermediate files

vista.ini	: Initial ini file for Vista which loads the Project.v2p and libraries.
Project.v2p	: Initial project definition.  This will work with the files created
		  and compiled by the Makefile

parameters.txt	: Initial parameters file.  Minimal contents
sc_main.cpp	: Basic sc_main which instantiates one element "top" from "top.h"
local		: Vista block diagram library containing one inital block, "top"
		  which is instantiated by the sc_main.cpp

emacs_vista	: Emacs initialization file which sets emacs to start in viper-mode.
		  This is a vi emulation mode for those who like to work in vi.
		  To use this file first type Alt-x in the emacs window under vista,
		  answer the question you are prompted with, saving the answers.
		  Then move the emacs_vista file to "$HOME/.emacs_vista". Now all editor
		  windows under Vista will be started in vi mode.

vista.preMakefile : Vista initialization makefile.  Move this file to "$HOME/.vista.preMakefile"
		  It will be executed every time you build a project under Vista.  This
		  is currently set to execute a Makefile in the users current working
		  directory.  This works with the Makefile included in this directory.
